# Evolution of GRIHA

The rapid increase in the Indian population and growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has given rise to an enormous demand for buildings, putting pressure on the availability of resources. Another key challenge for the built-environment of Indian cities is the diminishing availability of water for urban areas.

- **GRIHA-Prakriti Rating for Sustainable Schools** will be applicable only for existing school buildings in India.
- The rating system has **16 criteria**.
- The criteria are divided into **6 broad categories** namely: energy, comfort, water, trees, solid waste, management, and social.
- It will be mandatory to attempt certain points under each sub-group.
- The total points that a project can achieve are **50**.
- The rating will be done on a **1-5 star scale**.

## **Need**

Students spend almost half their waking hours – during their formative years – in schools. The values and lessons learned at school become the foundation for students’ outlook in life. Therefore, it is extremely important to ensure that students absorb maximum positive values from their time spent in schools. The key characteristics of a Sustainable school are – noise-free classrooms with ample daylight and thermal comfort, good indoor air quality, reduced energy and water consumption, adopt measures for maintaining good sanitation, plant sufficient trees in its surrounding, recycle waste, adopt measures for universal accessibility, and numerous other social and environmental activities.

Globally, several studies have revealed that sustainable schools offer a better and more comfortable learning environment to students. In addition, a sustainable school becomes a demonstration project through which students can learn the methods of reducing their environmental impacts – it becomes an environmental learning tool with fully functioning examples of eco-friendly strategies.

Therefore, GRIHA Council and TERI jointly developed the **GRIHA-Prakriti rating system**, with the intent to assist schools to reduce their environmental footprint while simultaneously empowering the next generation of citizens.

## **Process**

The GRIHA-Prakriti Rating process has been split into five parts:

1. **Registration**
2. **Collecting data and filling up the forms** – A team of students, under the guidance of teachers, will use various survey forms and calculators to collect data from across their school and analyze their environmental performance.
3. **On-site audit** – Once the forms and calculators are complete, GRIHA Council will send an energy expert on-site to carry out various on-site audits to cross-check the data. Post the audit, a report will be submitted to GRIHA Council.
4. **Final review** – GRIHA Council will review the reports and data submitted by the school and energy expert.
5. **Award of rating**

| Points achieved | Rating |
| --------------- |:------:|
| 25-29           |   ⭐   |
| 30-34           |   ⭐⭐  |
| 35-39           |  ⭐⭐⭐  |
| 40-44           | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 45-50           | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|

## **Criteria and their Weightage**

The criteria in the rating system address both qualitative and quantitative aspects. The rating has a total of 15 criteria plus 1 criterion for Innovation. The overall points for all criteria total up to 50, which have been equally distributed between Quantitative and Qualitative aspects as described in the table below.
